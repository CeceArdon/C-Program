# C-Program
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 
The first objective for project one was to create a menu based pseudocode that will print out the list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. The second objective for project one was to evaluate the run-time and memory of data structure that was going to be used to address the requirements. In Project two the first objective was to design a code that read the course data file correctly. The second objective was to design a menu-driven code. I had to develop a code that loads data from the file into the data structure. Furthermore, develop a code that would print the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order and print the course information.

How did you approach the problem? 
Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approach the problem by doing research on each data structure in order to make sure the correct data structure was chosen. It is important to know which data structure is needed in order for the program to run smoothly. Every program might not function correctly with just any data structure. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Every time I hit a roadblock I would do research, read books, or watch videos on YouTube till I came up with the solution for the issue. I gain a deeper understanding on what I was doing wrong and learn at the same time.  

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project helped me get a greater understanding of data structures and algorithms that I will be applying to future projects. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work in this project evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by applying the industry standard best practices in the code design.
